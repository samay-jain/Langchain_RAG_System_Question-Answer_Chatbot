# LangChain Q&A Chatbot with OpenAI & Ollama

This project demonstrates how to build a question-answering chatbot that extracts real content from websites, stores it using vector embeddings (ChromaDB), and answers natural language queries. Users can choose between using OpenAI's GPT models or running local inference with Ollama (e.g., LLaMA 3.2). Ideal for learning retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector databases, and multi-LLM integration using LangChain.
